## ðŸ“– Overview

This project investigates high-resolution (1 km) daily mapping of ground-level **PM2.5 concentrations** over **Tehran, Iran**, by combining:

- **MAIAC MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals**  
- **Meteorological data (ERA5/ERA5-Land reanalysis)**  
- **Ground-based PM2.5 observations**

A **machine learning-based framework** was developed, consisting of three main stages:

1. **Data preprocessing**  
   - Outlier removal  
   - AOD normalization  
   - Merging Aqua & Terra AODs  
   - Meteorological data interpolation  
   - Feature selection  

2. **Regression modeling**  
   - Tested algorithms: Linear models, SVR, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Deep Learning models, and **XGBoost**.  
   - **XGBoost achieved the best performance** with RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.74 and RMSE â‰ˆ 9 Î¼g/mÂ³.  

3. **Model deployment**  
   - Daily PM2.5 maps at 1 km resolution for Tehran (2013â€“2019).  
   - Demonstrated capability for different pollution scenarios (clean, moderate, unhealthy).

## ðŸ—‚ Data Sources

- **PM2.5 measurements**: Tehran Air Quality Control Company (AQCC)  
- **Satellite AOD (1 km)**: MODIS MAIAC (MCD19A2, Collection 6)  
- **Meteorological data**: ECMWF ERA5 / ERA5-Land (temperature, RH, PBLH, wind, radiation, etc.)  

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Preprocess the data**  
   - Apply outlier removal and corrections on PM2.5.  
   - Extract and normalize MAIAC AOD.  
   - Interpolate meteorological variables to station locations.  

2. **Train regression models**  
   - Run provided scripts to compare different models (linear, SVR, RF, XGBoost, etc.).  
   - Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².  

3. **Generate PM2.5 maps**  
   - Deploy the trained model to produce daily PM2.5 grids at 1 km resolution.  
   - Example output maps are included in the manuscript (Fig. 8).

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **Best model**: **XGBoost**  
- **Performance on test data**:  
  - RMSE = 8.97 Î¼g/mÂ³  
  - MAE = 6.88 Î¼g/mÂ³  
  - RÂ² = 0.74  
- Successfully produced **daily, 1 km PM2.5 maps** for Tehran (2013â€“2019), outperforming earlier studies (which used 3â€“10 km MODIS AOD products).
